"""
Obsidian to Anki Exporter
=========================
Reads markdown study notes from your Obsidian vault, extracts flashcards
from Q&A blocks and Cloze paragraphs in the ## Flashcards section, copies
any referenced images to Anki's media folder, and generates .txt files
ready for Anki import.

No plugins required — only Obsidian, Anki, and Python.
